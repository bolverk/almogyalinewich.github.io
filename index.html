								<b>Supernovae</b><br>Despite decades of research, many questions regarding the nature of supernovae remains a mystery. These questions include what kinds of stars explode? What are their properties before the explosion? what is the process that powers these explosions? how does this explosion affect its environment and whether a compact object (i.e. a neutron star or a black hole) is born in the explosion, and if so, what are its properties.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Explosions as Probes of Galactic Plasma</b><br>Some astrophysical explosions produce non thermal radio emission that can be used to probe the properties of the plasma in the environment in which they occur. In supernovae, this phenomenon can teach us about mass loss prior to the explosion, and in tidal disruption events, it can teach us about the properties of other galactic centres.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Planetary Collisions</b><br>Terrestrial planets are thought to form through the violent mergers of planetary embryos. Each one of these mergers involves an giant impact event on the growing planet, which can erode its atmosphere. My research involves developing a theoretical model to predict how much atmosphere will be lost in this process. Another open question in planet formation concerns the timescales for these collisions. The current thinking is that the planetary embryos all start out on circular, non intersecting orbits, and that dynamical instabilities modify these orbits, eventually bringing about collisions. Part of my research is developing a theoretical model to predict the timescale for the development of these instabilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Numerical Hydrodynamics</b><br>I co developed, together with Elad Steinberg, a numerical hydrodynamic simulation based on a moving Voronoi mesh in c++. This hydrocode is the backbone to many of my works. It combines the strengths of grid based methods (like the Godunov scheme) and the flexibility of Lagrangian methods (like smooth particle hydrodynamics). The code is called <a href="https://github.com/bolverk/huji-rich">RICH</a>, which stands for Racah Institute (physics department at the Hebrew University) Computational Hydrodynamics. As far as I know, it is the only open source, object oriented hydrocode. As such, new physics can be incorporated in the simulation without modifying existing code.
